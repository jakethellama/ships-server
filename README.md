# Ships Server

An almost fully built version of Ships Server is in /dist. Just place a [pixi.mjs](https://github.com/pixijs/pixijs/releases) file under /dist before running.

I used v8.4.0 of the Development Build.

## Building

Make sure to grab a version of [PixiJS](https://github.com/pixijs/pixijs/releases) before building! Place the pixi.mjs file under /src.

I used v8.4.0 of the Development Build.
