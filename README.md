### Playing

A nearly fully built version of Ships Server is in <code>/dist</code>. Just place a <code>[pixi.mjs](https://github.com/pixijs/pixijs/releases)</code> file under <code>/dist</code> before running.

I used v8.4.0 of the PixiJS Development Build.
```
node ./dist/main.js
```


### Developing & Building

Make sure to grab a version of [PixiJS](https://github.com/pixijs/pixijs/releases) before developing or building! Place the <code>pixi.mjs</code> file under <code>/src</code>.

I used v8.4.0 of the PixiJS Development Build.
```
npm run build
```
